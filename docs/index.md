# Pinax Stripe Documentation

[Pinax](http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/) is an open source ecosystem
of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates.

As a reusable Django app, `pinax-stripe` provides the ecosystem with
a well tested, documented, and proven Stripe integration story for
any site that needs payments.

## Finding Help

The primary place to find a helpful hand in our [Slack](http://slack.pinaxproject.com/)
instance. Ask around in `#general` or `#pinax-stripe` channels there if you
need anything at all.

If you think you encountering a bug either in the code, or in the docs (after
all if something is not clear in the docs, then it should be considered a
bug in the documentation, most of the time), then please [file an issue](http://github.com/pinax/pinax-stripe/issues/) with the project.
